# Chaos-Saver
MacOS screensaver written in Swift

A MacOS screensaver port of [HackerPoet's Chaos-Equations](https://github.com/HackerPoet/Chaos-Equations). Download the latest build [here](https://github.com/afflitto/Chaos-Saver/releases/latest).

This is still a work in progress. I still would like to implement the rolling timestep feature of the original Chaos-Equations and add screensaver preferences.
